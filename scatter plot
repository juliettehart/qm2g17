#code for timeline scatter plots with matplotlib

#Author: Claudia 

#importing libraries, pandas to read the csv, matplotlib to create the graph
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('seaborn')

#you have to change the file name everytime, haven't tried adding in a for loop, so this code will produce the graph for 1990, when doing 1991 the line below will end with 1991-Table 1.csv

#reading the csv file with pandas 
data = pd.read_csv('/Users/claudianashef/Documents/Uni/Second Year /BASC0005/Project Coding /Socioeconomic Factors Data QM/1990-Table 1.csv')
#assigning factors to the x and y of the graph, and making sure python recognises our third factor - female labour participation rate (%)
x = data['HDI']
y = data['Population Growth Rate (%)']
female_labour_rate = data['female work force'] 

#drawing the scatter plot, assigning the colour of the points to female labour participation rate using the colour gradient "autumn"
plt.scatter(x, y, c = female_labour_rate, cmap = 'autumn', edgecolor = 'black', 
            linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.75, s = 100) #size of plots 

#colour bar here is the rhs bar that shows the gradient being used for colour of plots for female labour participation rate 
cbar = plt.colorbar()
cbar.set_label('Female Labour Participation Rate \n (% of female population 15 years +)')

#labelling the graph
plt.title('Population Growth Rate, Female Labour Participation Rate and HDI by Country in 1990')
plt.xlabel('HDI')
plt.ylabel('Population Growth Rate (%)')
