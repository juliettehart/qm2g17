#Histograms

#Author: Claudia 

#So essentially each set of code is only slightly different depending on the file path and titles
#Here is the histogram code for the Education Index for All Countries, 2019

import pandas as pd                   #importing to pandas to use it to read the csv data file
import plotly.express as px           #importing plotly to build the histogram

#just reading the data 
data = pd.read_csv('/Users/claudianashef/Documents/Uni/Second Year /BASC0005/Project Coding /DATA/Socioeconomic Factors Data QM - CSV/2019-Table 1.csv')

#naming the histogram, and plotting it 
histogram = px.histogram(data,                            #this tells plotly to use the data located above by pandas for the histogram
                         x='Education_2019',              #this tells plotly to use the column of data titled Education_2019
                         labels = {"Education_2019":"Education Index"},   #this renames the x axis, otherwise would automatically use data column title
                         title = 'Distribution of Education Index for All Countries, 2019')  #this sets the title of the histogram 
#shows the plotted histogram
histogram.show()
